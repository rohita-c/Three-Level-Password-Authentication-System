# Three-Level-Password-Authentication-System

The objective of this project is to design and implement a three-layer authentication system that includes knowledge-based and device-based authentication methods to ensure the highest level of security for the users. It should be easy to use, yet highly secure. It should be able to integrate with existing systems and allow for seamless authentication across multiple devices and platforms. The system should also provide a flexible, scalable, and customizable solution that can be easily adapted to meet the changing needs of the organization.

The three levels used here are Login layer, OTP layer and QR code layer
